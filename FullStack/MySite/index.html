      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">Since I was young, I have had the desire to increase my knowledge on anything that piqued my
        interest. Throughout my education, I found myself drawn to mathematics and computer science. My focus
        became technology.  I continue to expand my knowledge with books, college courses and on-line training,
        validating when I can through recognized certifications.</p>

        <h3>Planning / Brainstorming / Requirements Analysis</h3>
        <p>There are several instances in my career where I have participated in the initial stages of developing new
          software.  Forefront in my memory was joining a small startup as an OOA / OOD / OOP SME, to create a new Electroinc
          Medical Record in the mid 1990's.  Collaborating with doctors, nurses, insurance professionals
          and other technology staff.  Clinicians where looking to capture basic patient visit information and chart out
          historical biological data real-time, provide patient education material, a configurable diagnosis support
          systems, and a coding module that allowed office staff to match CPT(procedural) codes to ICD(diagnosis) codes
          for insurance submission.  Microsoft Project was utilized to document requirements and capture estimates to
          provide the product owner with visible progess and delivery dates.</p>

        <h3>Defining / Designing / Prototyping</h3>
        <p>Giving requirements life can be an existing time.  Iteratively producing a prototype invigorates the developers
          and excites the product owner to see their concept become reality.  As an integration developer I've utilized
          SOAP UI to create Mock SOAP Services in the Financial, Insurance and Medical industry to assist in building and
          testing ACORD transactions for an Enterprise Service Bus.
